I'm Alex, a CS student at National University of Singapore. I have experience working across the full web development stack. Being a generalist, I do not tie myself to a single platform or programming language. My academic interest lies in programming language implementations. Lately, I'm trying to deep dive into this area, and it has been fascinating so far.

I was born in Dalian, which is a coastal city in Liaoning, China, and have spent a good chunk of my life in Beijing before immigrating to Singapore. Now, I consider myself more or less a Singaporean, save for a bit of Beijing accent. I relish eating our local fare, and I think <i>bak chor mee</i> is the best thing ever since sliced bread.

If you are working with me in any professional capacity, it'd be helpful to know that I am hearing impaired. I was diagnosed with moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss since young. I am not too bothered by this, as I got a good pair of hearing aids. However, I'll really appreciate it if you can speak loud and clear. 

If you have time, feel free to explore my blog on ruminations on things I care about. 

See you around. :-)
