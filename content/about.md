I'm Alex. I have experience working across the full web development stack. Being a generalist, I do not tie myself to a single platform or programming language. I have interests in programming languages, distributed systems and operating systems.

I was born in Dalian, which is a coastal city in Liaoning, China, and have spent my formative years in Beijing before immigrating to Singapore. Now, I consider myself more or less a Singaporean, save for a bit of Beijing accent. I relish eating our local fare, and I think <i>bak chor mee</i> is the best thing ever since sliced bread.

If you are working with me in any professional capacity, it'd be helpful to know that I am hearing impaired. I was diagnosed with moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss since young. I am not too bothered by this, as I got a good pair of hearing aids. However, I'll really appreciate it if you can speak loud and clear. 

If you have time, feel free to explore my blog. 

See you around. :-)
